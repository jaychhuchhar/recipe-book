  <InstructionsSection title="Prepare the Dough">
    <InstructionStep stepNumber={1}>
      Activate <strong>yeast</strong> (if using active dry <strong>yeast</strong>, skip if <strong>instant</strong>): Warm the <strong>milk</strong> + <strong>water</strong> (should be just <strong>lukewarm</strong>, not hot).

## Ingredients
- Warm Milk (35℃ to 45℃) (1 Cup)
- Powdered Sugar (2 Tbsp)
- Active Dry Yeast (1 Tbsp)
- Milk Powder (2 Tbsp)
- Wheat Flour (3 Cup)
- Salt (1 Tsp)
- Oil (Any) (2 Tbsp)
- Water (100 ml)

## Instructions

### Prepare Dough
1. Take Warm Milk in a mixing bowl. Add Powdered Sugar and Yeast to it and mix well.
2. Rest for 10 min to 12 min for yeast to activate. Once froth is visible, yeast is activated and ready.
3. Add Milk Powder, Wheat Flour, Salt and Oil and mix well.
4. Add Water and mix well.
5. Knead on a working surface for about 15 min. Try not to use additional flour.
6. Once kneaded, rest the dough in a lightly greased bowl for 1.5 hour to 2 hour. Dough will rise and double in size.
7. Knock down to release the trapped air, take the dough out to working surface and shape it. Folding from all side is a good technique. Shape the dough in loaf shape.
8. Rest the dough again in loaf pan for about 30 min. Brush with milk on top.
9. Preheat the oven to 180℃ and bake for 25 min to 45 min depending on size of loaf and until the toothpick comes out clean.
10. Once baked, let it rest for few minutes before taking out the bread. Let the bread cool down for 10 min to 15 min.

## Ingredients
- All-Purpose Flour/Maida (1.5 kg / 12 cups)
- Instant Yeast (18 g / 3 tsp / 1 heaped tbsp)
- Sugar (6 tbsp)
- Salt (3 tsp)
- Lukewarm Milk (600 ml)
- Lukewarm Water (300 ml, adjust as needed)
- Butter or Oil (120 g / ½ cup, melted + extra for brushing)
- Milk for Brushing (3-4 tbsp)

## Instructions

### Prepare the Dough
1. Activate yeast (if using active dry yeast, skip if instant): Warm the milk + water (should be just lukewarm, not hot). Add sugar and yeast, mix. Let sit 8-10 minutes until frothy.

2. Make dough: In a large bowl (or stand mixer), mix flour and salt. Add yeast mixture and melted butter. Knead well (10-12 minutes by hand or 8-10 minutes in mixer) until smooth, soft, and slightly sticky but elastic.

3. First rise: Cover and keep in a warm spot 1-1.5 hours until doubled in size.

### Shape and Bake
4. Shape pav: Punch down dough. Divide into 25-30 equal balls (≈ 80-90 g each). Shape smooth balls and place them slightly touching in a large greased baking tray (or multiple trays).

5. Second rise: Cover and let rise again 40-60 minutes until puffed up and joined together.

6. Preheat oven to 200°C (390°F). Brush tops with milk.

7. Bake 18-22 minutes until golden brown.

8. Finish: Brush hot pav with melted butter for that soft, shiny look. Cool on a wire rack for 10-15 minutes, then pull apart.

## Notes
- For active dry yeast, activate it first with warm liquid and sugar. For instant yeast, you can add it directly to the flour
- The dough should be soft and slightly sticky but not wet. Adjust water/milk as needed
- Pav should be golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom
- Store covered at room temperature for 2-3 days or freeze for longer storage
- Perfect for vada pav, pav bhaji, or as dinner rolls
- Total time including rising is approximately 3 hours 20 minutes

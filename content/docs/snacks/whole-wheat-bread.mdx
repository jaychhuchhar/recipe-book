  <RecipeInstructionsSection title="Prepare Dough">
    <RecipeInstructionsStep>
      Take <strong>Warm Milk</strong> in a mixing bowl. Add <strong>Powdered Sugar</strong> and <strong>Yeast</strong> to it and mix well.
    </RecipeInstructionsStep>
    <RecipeInstructionsStep>
      Rest for <strong>10 min</strong> to <strong>12 min</strong> for yeast to activate. Once froth is visible, yeast is activated and ready.
    </RecipeInstructionsStep>
    <RecipeInstructionsStep>
      Add <strong>Milk Powder</strong>, <strong>Wheat Flour</strong>, <strong>Salt</strong> and <strong>Oil</strong> and mix well.

      Knead on a working surface for about <strong>15 min</strong>. Try not to use additional flour.
    </RecipeInstructionsStep>

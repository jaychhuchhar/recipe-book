### Notes

<RecipeNotes>
  <>Use aged basmati rice for best results</>
  <>Don't overcook the rice - it should be 70% to 80% cooked before layering</>
  <>Dum cooking is crucial - keep heat very low to avoid burning. Use a heavy weight or dough on the rim to keep it sealed</>
  <>Let the biryani rest for 15 to 20 minutes before opening the lid</>
  <>Serve hot with raita and/or salan on the side</>
  <>Can be stored in refrigerator for up to 3 days in an airtight container</>
  <>If you don't have a heavy weight, place the kadhai on a tawa/griddle to prevent bottom burning during dum cooking</>

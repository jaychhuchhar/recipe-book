### Saffron Milk
03. In a bowl, mix saffron strands and lukewarm or room temperature milk and set it aside for later.

### Eggs and Potato
04. Boil the eggs, peel and keep them aside for later.
05. Use a fork to poke holes all over the potatoes so they cook thoroughly and the masala penetrates well.
06. Soak the potatoes in salt and turmeric water for about 10 mins.
07. Potatoes can be fried in oil or AirFried (25 Min at 180 C).
08. Once ready keep them aside for later.

### Rice Preparation
09. In a big pan or kadhai, add water and all the spices.
    Alt: Infusing Water with Spices 
10. Let the water boil for a few minutes so that spices are infused. Add ghee for aroma.

11. Use a strainer and remove the whole spices.
12. Add rice and cook at high flame for a few minutes.
13. Set the flame to low, close the lid and cook for additional 5 to 10 minutes or until rice is about 70% to 80% cooked. You can check by pressing a grain in the palm. It should have just a little bit of bite remaining.
14. Strain the rice, pour cold water on top to completely stop the cooking process. Set aside for later.

### Masala
15. Heat a big kadhai, add oil and ghee. Now add the onions and fry until golden. Keep 1/4 onion aside for later.
    Alt: Frying Onion 1
    Alt: Frying Onion 2
16. Add chicken and potato. Mix them well and cook for 15 mins or until almost cooked. Keep the lid closed and add water if needed to prevent the spices from burning or chicken from sticking to the kadhai. Once cooked, keep half cup of gravy aside for later.
    Alt: Add Chicken and Potato 1
    Alt: Add Chicken and Potato 2
17. Add peeled eggs and mix well. Turn down the heat at this stage.
    Alt: Add Peeled Eggs

### Layering
18. In the kadhai, layer the cooked rice. We can add half of rice in first layer and then half in the second layer.
    Alt: Layer the Rice
19. In each layer, add mint leaves, curry and onion we set aside.
    Alt: Add Curry, Mint Leaves
20. On top of last layer, add the saffron milk.
21. Now close the lid. Either seal it by using dough around the rim or add a heavy weight on top. Cook on high flame for a few minutes to bring the curry to boil.
    Alt: Dum Cook
22. Turn down the heat to lowest and cook for 15 to 20 minutes.
23. Turn off the flame and let it cool down for additional 15 to 20 minutes.
24. Open the lid and using a spatula, gently mix the curry into rice. Do not mix thoroughly - you want to see distinct layers of white and colored rice.
    Alt: Mix and Remove Excess Heat
25. Serve hot in a plate and enjoy.
    Alt: Serve Hot and Enjoy

## Notes
- Use aged basmati rice for best results
- Don't overcook the rice - it should be 70% to 80% cooked before layering
- Dum cooking is crucial - keep heat very low to avoid burning. Use a heavy weight or dough on the rim to keep it sealed
- Let the biryani rest for 15 to 20 minutes before opening the lid
- Serve hot with raita and/or salan on the side
- Can be stored in refrigerator for up to 3 days in an airtight container
- If you don't have a heavy weight, place the kadhai on a tawa/griddle to prevent bottom burning during dum cooking
